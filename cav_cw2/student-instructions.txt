Computer Animation and Visualisation: Assignment 2

Volume rendering with Transparency

Students are required to render 3D volume data using Composite Intensity Projection (CIP). Students must design and implement transfer functions to highlight materials of different density. Note: you must not use the 3D rendering functions of OpenGL (e.g. alpha blending).
A basic program to load and visualize volume data is provided (click here). You may use it as a starting point. Example volume data is also provided (human head). 

Requirements

* Produce a program to show the skin overlapped with the skeleton, by tuning the colour and opacity transfer functions.
* Volume rendering by casting rays that are axis-aligned and clear visualization of the skin and the skeleton (x, y and z directions). (70 marks).
* Bonus Marks (30 marks): 
	- Ray tracing in 3D. 
	- Comparison of ray casting: "Front-to-Back" CIP using empty-space leaping optimization, verses simple "Back-to-Front" CIP. 
	- Additional interfaces to change view points
	- Focal distance. 
	- Transfer functions.
	- Comparison of different schemes (shear warping / traversal vs. sampling, trilinear interpolation vs. nearest neighbour)
	- Using enhanced methods e.g. local illumination and multidimensional transfer functions using gradient information.
* A README file giving clear instructions about your source code and stating what you have done. Especially, you must mention about the additional functions for the bonus marks.
* Your program must be written using C++ and OpenGL. It must run on DICE.
