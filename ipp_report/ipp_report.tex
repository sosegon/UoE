\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Learning requires a considerable amount of mental effort. The amount of the mental effort expended in the learning process greatly depends on the perception of learners about the source of knowledge and the context of learning \citep{salomon1983differential}. It follows, that under conditions where people perceive the source of knowledge in a positive manner, the learning process requires less mental effort, therefore, it is easier, more pleasant, and provides better results \citep{salomon1984television}.

Traditional learning schemes have tried to include elements from new technologies with the objective of making the learning process more appealing for people. One of such approaches is known as serious games \citep{michael2005serious}. This alternative aims to take advantage of the pedagogical value of fun, competition and leisure to accomplish that objective. This technique has proved to provide benefits in the acquisition of new knowledge and skills \citep{graafland2012systematic}.

Even though the proven benefits of serious games, it is narrowed to specific fields and contexts. Moreover, the considerable number of resources necessitated to develop such type of solutions, makes it impractical in broader contexts. Under such circumstances, other alternatives have emerged to leverage the benefits of leisure and entertainment, but including capacities of flexibility and adaptation. One of such approaches is known as gamification.

The main objective of gamification is to increase the user engagement of products, services or processes by including game elements and principles to make them more appealing. The range of scenarios of usage of this technique is broader and includes organizational productivity \citep{zichermann2011gamification}, physical exercise \citep{hamari2015working} and learning \citep{hamari2016challenging}.

In the learning context, gamification has proved to be effective for different target audiences including primary school students \citep{boticki2015usage}, undergraduate students \citep{slish2015gamification}, and the general public \citep{disalvo2014khan}. The types of learning products, platforms and services that have implemented gamification are wide including mobile applications \citep{su2015mobile}, web sites \citep{gene2014gamification} and desktop software \citep{cheong2013quick}. These conditions ratify the flexible nature of gamification and its ability to be adapted to different environments.

Before the raise of technological techniques aimed to leverage the benefits of good perceptions of learning contexts, there were other alternatives aimed to facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge. One of these techniques was oriented to exploit the spacing effect phenomenon to increase the capacity of retention of specific contents. This technique is known as spaced repetition.

One of the foundations of spaced repetition is the acquisition of new content by recurrent revisions in a series of short learning sessions scattered over fixed or variable intervals of time. These conditions increase the capacity of retention compared to the acquirement of knowledge in a single massive learning session. Thus, the difficulty of remembering new facts, concepts or definitions is diminished and mental processes like recognition and recall are boosted.

Originally, spaced repetition is implemented with flashcards. Each one of them containing one or multiple related concepts. The flashcards are grouped based on how well the leaner remembers the content within them. Then, the group of flashcards with more challenging content is presented to the learner more frequently. Flashcards move from one group to another as the learner keeps progressing in each session.

Spaced repetition has also taken advantage of new technologies. Thus, different pieces of software have been developed to make it more accessible through different platforms and interfaces. Each of these implementations has its own characteristics depending on the target audience. Some solutions are focused in topics like learning languages \citep{duolingo}, whereas other have broader and more general scopes \citep{flipquiz} and \citep{anki}. 

The current document presents a proposal to gamify an existing mobile software implementation of spaced repetition. The ultimate objective is to create a more appealing version to increase the user engagement aimed to improve its effectiveness. The following sections describe the design of the solution, methodology for evaluation, risk management strategy, and execution plan.

\section{Design}
\label{sec:design}

The usual way to implement gamification into existing solutions is to append game principles and elements throughout the use of the application. An example of this approach is the addition of a leaderboard of the users based on points earned while using the application. Such leaderboard adds another motivation to use the application in order the reach the top of the classification. Overall, this way of implementing gamification means that the entire user experience can be converted into a game context.

For the current proposal, the way to implement gamification is different to the traditional one. Rather than appending game elements into the spaced repetition software, the project aims to fuse it with an existing game. Thus, two software components will be integrated as a single application. This condition poses a complexity in setting the balance of the main context for the final solution. Based on this, there are two alternatives to implement the application. 

The first option requires the spaced repetition component to be the main activity of the final application. Such requirement means that using spaced repetition and playing the game would occur in interleaved stages as seen in Figure 1. The implementation of this option would be straightforward, however, a potential problem would be the lack of interconnection between the game and spaced repetition. Thus, each component could be interpreted as an interruption of the other. 

For the second alternative, the game would take the main role. Evidently, a similar situation of interruptions could occur. However, that potential issue would be avoided by creating a true connection between the game and spaced repetition. The level of complexity of the implementation would be higher compared to the first option, but the potential benefits would be higher as well. The details of this approach along with the descriptions of the spaced repetition software and the game are described in the following subsections.

\subsection{Integration of spaced repetition into an existing game}

As described in the introduction section (\ref{sec:intro}), when the source of knowledge is perceived in a positive way, the learning process requires less mental effort and it is more pleasant. Based on this idea, it is safe to assume that playing a game is perceived more positively than executing spaced repetition. For this reason, the main context of the final application will be the game component, and the spaced repetition component will complement it. 

The final application will integrate the spaced repetition and game components as a single piece of software. Thus, it is necessary to implement a connection between both component. As mentioned previously, one of the objectives of such connection is to avoid the user interpreting the components as interruptions of each other. However, the main goal is to establish a relationship such the output of using one component can be seen as a valuable resource to be used in the other component as seen in Figure 2.

Since the main context of the final application will be the game, the spaced repetition component needs to be connected in a way such the users find worth using that component. One alternative is to reward the users when using the spaced repetition component. Then the reward can be using during the game. Such rewards can be implemented as points to reach higher positions in a leaderboard, or as resources that can be used to ease the game.

A similar scheme was proposed in previous work \citep{johnson2012leveraging}. There, the flow of the final application was split into two phases: points earning and game playing. During the first phase the participants obtained points in two stages. In the first stage, the participants reviewed content using spaced repetition. The second stage consisted of a quiz where points were granted based on the number of correct answers. Then, those points could be used during the game.

There are other mechanisms that can be used to reward users and motivate them to use the spaced repetition software. However, for simplicity and ease of implementation, only the scheme of points earning will be taken into consideration. Therefore, the usage of the application will be split into two stages: points earning and game playing. The main difference with the scheme in \citep{johnson2012leveraging} is the flexibility of executing the points earning stage. 

In the original scheme, the flow of the stages was fixed and the participants were able to earn points only at the beginning of each game session. For the current design, that flow is still valid and the points earning stage will be mandatory. However, the participants will also have a single extra opportunity to earn points. They will be able to execute the spaced repetition component at any time while playing the game. The application will suggest that option to the participants especially during challenging levels.

\subsection{The spaced repetition component: AnkiDroid}

Among all the available spaced repetition software only few of them are open source. The most relevant option is Anki \citep{anki} which is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3) for most of its platform versions except iOS. Therefore, it is possible to modify the existing source code and adapt it as convenience. 

Anki makes spaced repetition more accessible to a wider audience by providing web, desktop and mobile interfaces. Anki provides a group of characteristics of spaced repetition [MENTION FEATURES], it also gives different fields of study and it is customisable. 

The Anki version for Android devices is known as AnkiDroid. It provides an intuitive user interface that follows the best practices for mobile development. However, the lack of elements that motivate its usage might make it boring for some users which makes it a good fit for the current project.

\subsection{The game: 2048}

Since the selected spaced repetition component is implemented for Android devices, it is necessary to choose a game for the same platform. Among the huge number of games available in Android, just a few of them are open source. The selected game for the current project is the popular 2048. It is distributed under the MIT License, which is compatible with other licenses including AGPLv3. This way it is possible to modify the code as convenience as well.

2048 was first developed for web environments, but ever since it has been ported to many other platforms. It is an sliding puzzle which ultimate objective is to merge numbered blocks until create a tile with the number 2048. Blocks are distributed over a grid of cells of variable size, but the default number of cells is 4x4. At the start of the game, two randomly positioned tiles holding the number 2 are displayed in the grid as seen in Figure 1.

A player has to  slide the blocks horizontally or vertically. The cells are moved in the chosen direction and they are stopped by the edges or when colliding when other cells. If two cells holding the same numbers collide, then they are merged into a single cell holding the sum of the values of the previous cells. In every turn a new cell holding a power of two number is randomly positioned in the grid, being the power an integer between 1 and 10 as seen in expression (\ref{eq:eq1});

\begin{center}
	\begin{equation}
		Number\ in\ tile\ =\ 2^{x},\ x\in \{1,\ 2,\dots,\ 10\}
		\label{eq:eq1}
	\end{equation}
\end{center}

The game ends if one of the following states is reached:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A tile holding the number 2048 is created.
	\item The grid is full of blocks, none of them holding the number 2048.
\end{enumerate}

The first state implies that the user has won. Nonetheless, the user can continue playing to create tiles with numbers higher than 2048. The second states indicates that the user has lost. Therefore, a new session has to be initiated to play again.

\section{Evaluation}
The evaluation process requires to measure the variation of user engagement in the gamified version of the spaced repetition software. At first user engagement can be seen as a subjective concept, thus difficult to measure. One first approach would be to perform a qualitative analysis of the application. To do so, the type of required information would be related to the perception of the user about the application. Such information would have the form of opinions, comments, and suggestions from the users.

Collecting qualitative data can be expensive since it might require to interview the participants after using the application. Alternatively, surveys or questionnaires could be utilised to collect that type information. However, the biggest problem is that this kind of information is difficult to analyse. Moreover, the information could be biased by the mood of the participants and other uncontrolled factors when collecting it. Under such conditions, it would be highly difficult to replicate the evaluation.

Some methods have been developed to cope with the difficulty of measuring user engagement. One of them is the development of a framework to measure user engagement \citep{o2010development} by assessing parameters like perceived usability, aesthetics and felt involvement. Such assessment is performed through a series of surveys. Even though this option tries to minimize the problems related to collecting and analysing qualitative data, its main problem is that it is a general purpose framework that needs for a considerable amount of information. Thus, it can be difficult to adapt it when the number of participants is small.

Due to the difficulty pertaining to gathering and analysing qualitative data, the evaluation for the current project will be done in terms of quantitative data. This will ease the collection of data and its analysis. Moreover, it will permit to replicate the evaluation or perform a new one with modified conditions in order to make comparisons. The details of the evaluation method will be described in the following subsections.

\subsection{Participants}
There will be two groups of participants. The first one will be the control group. The participants in this group will use a version of AnkiDroid with no gamification characteristics. The data obtained from this group will be used as a benchmark to measure the variation in user engagement. The second group will be the experimental group. The participants in this group will use the gamified version of AnkiDroid.

The results obtained from the experimental group will be compared against the benchmark from the control group. The expectation is that there will be differences between both results. The analysis of those differences will allow to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of gamification for spaced repetition software.

The number of total participants will depend on the availability of subjects to participate in the evaluation of the final application. The expectation is to have between seven and ten people in every group. In any case, the number of members in both groups will be the same so the amount of collected data will be comparable. 

AnkiDroid is a general purpose implementation of spaced repetition. Thus, it can be used for any person that have access to an Android device. In fact, the published application in Google Play falls in the content rating \textit{Everyone}, so there is no restriction in the age of its users. Such situation means that the constraints in the selection of the participants are minimum.

Even though the minimum constraints in the selection of participants, it is important to maintain a level of homogeneity among them. Thus, the complexity in the analysis of the results from the control and experimental will be further reduced. A potential issue with this condition is the level of generalizability of the results. It will be difficult to extrapolate the results to other groups of the general population.

Finally, the participants will use the final application at any time during their daily activities. This means the application will be used in an uncontrolled environment. There are several potential issues for such condition. However, the most relevant one is that the user might forget to use the application, therefore not enough data will be generated. To diminish such situation, the application will sent daily notifications to remember to use it. Evidently, the frequency of such notifications has to be moderated to avoid the users perceive them as intrusive.

\subsection{Quantitative data}
The approach to measure the effects of gamification applied to a spaced repetition software will be done through quantitative data. There are two parameters to measure. The first one is the user engagement, which can be measured by collecting and analysing different types of data from the application including time of use, frequency of use, and commonly used features. The second parameter is the effectiveness of spaced repetition when it is implemented with gamification. This parameter require to test how much knowledge has been retained by the participants after using the application.

\subsubsection{User engagement}
There are three types of data to be collected from the usage of the application:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Time in session (TIS):}  It is the time the users spend every occasion they use the application. It is measured in minutes per session.
	\item \textbf{Frequency of sessions (FOS):} It is the time between sessions. It is measured in hours between two consecutive sessions.
	\item \textbf{Frequency of spaced repetition features (FOSR):} It is the number of times spaced repetition features are used in every session. It is measured in number of times per session.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Spaced repetition effectiveness}
The data to measure the spaced repetition effectiveness will be collected during the usage of the application and in a final test to be taken by the participants. Such information will take the form of following scores:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Score in session (SIS):} The score obtained in the quiz taken during a session of usage. It is measured as the number of correctly answered question divided by the total number of questions.
	\item \textbf{Final score (FS):} The score obtained in the final test. It is measured as the number of correctly answered question divided by the total number of questions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hypotheses}
The main objectives of the project are to increase the user engagement of AnkiDroid, and measure the effectiveness of spaced repetition when implemented with gamification. Thus, the following hypotheses need to be confirmed or denied:

\begin{displayquote}
\textbf{H1: } The participants in the experimental group will spend more time using the application than the participants in the control group.
\end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}
\textbf{H2: } The participants in the experimental group will obtain higher scores than the participants in the control group.
\end{displayquote}

\subsection{Analysis}
The analysis of the collected information will be aimed to confirm or deny the hypotheses to some level of confidence. 

\section{Tasks and Schedule}
The execution of the project is defined in a series of tasks with specific goals. Each task has a number of resources, a duration, and outputs that might be required in a following stage. Potential risks are also identified and classified. The next subsections describe the details of each task.

\subsection{Design of the final application}
An overview of the general aspects of the design has been described previously (\ref{sec:design}). However, specific details about use case, application features, user interface components, and user interactions are still required. The objective of such details is to clearly establish the scope and context of the final application. Those details will be described in a specifications document.

Based on the specifications document, a first prototype of the user interface will be created on paper. Then, the prototype will be evaluated using a cognitive walkthrough approach \citep{helander2014handbook} to detect potential flaws in the design for first time users. All of the participants in the testing stage will be considered first time users since the application will be new. The result of this analysis will be used to improve the design of the user interface.

The execution of this task is critical since its results will be the foundations for the implementation and analysis stages. The specifications document will contain not only the details of the application from the perspective of the user, but it will also contain the type of information to be collected to perform the analysis. The outcome of this stage will be a specifications document containing details about the features of the application along with sketches of the user interface. The duration of this task will be one week.

\subsection{Implementation of the design}
This stage corresponds to implementing the application based on the output from the previous stage. This stage is divide into iterative phases. At the end of each phase, an updated version of the application will be released. Each new version will contain additional features and will fix bugs from the previous ones.

Each one of the iterative phases is expected to last one week. The total number of phases will be five. An additional iteration lasting one week will be needed to perform beta tests. The implementation stage will end once the beta tests have been executed, and the final version of the application has been released.

\subsection{Ethics approval for research}
Since testing the application will require the participation of humans, it will be necessary to obtain the corresponding approval from The School of Informatics. The objective of this stage is to make sure that the activities during the testing stage will follow the guidelines from the School Ethics Code and ethics regulations at the College and University, therefore, no harm will be caused to the participants.

This stage will require to fill and submit a Level 1 Ethics Procedure form along with the details of the project, and the consent form to be signed by the participants to make sure they understand the implications of the study. This will need to be done early during the development of the project; ideally, after the design of the application is done.

\subsection{Recruitment of participants}
Once the final version of the application has been released, it will have to be tested by the participants in the control and experimental groups. At this point the participants will have been recruited already. Moreover, they will have to be aware of the objective of the testing stage and their role. Such scenario poses a contact with potential participant as early as possible.

Ideally, potential participants will be contacted during the first steps of the implementation stage when a basic functional version of the application is already released. The objective is to be able to provide screen-shots of the interface of the application. Thus, the potential candidates will have a rough idea of the look and feeling of the application. The expectation is that this strategy will help potential candidates to make a positive decision.

Finally, the actual participants will have to be recruited before the release of the final version of the application. It follows that the participants will be fully aware of their role, the objective of the testing, the duration of the testing period, and the information that will be collected. To do so, they will have to sign the consent form previously approved by The School of Informatics.

\subsection{Testing of the final application}
The participants will test the final version of the application. As mentioned, there will be two groups: control and experimental. The users will not be informed to which group they belong to. The objective is to avoid potential biases due to the users knowing what the expected outcomes from one group or another are. After signing the consent form, they will be given the resources to install the application.

The testing stage will last between two and three weeks. During this time, the participants are expected to use the application in a daily basis. Daily notifications will be sent remembering to use the application. The data from the application will be collected remotely as long as the participants are connected to a free wifi service to avoid extra charges in their mobile service.

The testing stage will require the participants to take a final quiz. Such quiz will be taken within the application. The participants will be notified remotely about the final quiz. After completing that quiz, the participants will be informed that testing period has ended and they will be free to uninstall the application. After ending the testing period, the participants will receive a monetary compensation.

\subsection{Analysis of data}
The data collected during the testing stage will be used to perform analysis related to the user engagement and spaced repetition effectiveness. Since, the data will be gathered remotely, it will be possible to start the analysis before the end of the testing stage. The expectation is that in the middle of the testing stage there will be enough data that can be used to find trends in the usage of the application.

The analysis process can be speed up by performing automated routines to clean and pre-process the data in a daily basis. Then, once all the data have been collected, a simple processing will be required. The outcome of this stage will be a series of statistical parameters that characterize the usage of the application in the control and experimental group. This information will be used to confirm or deny the hypotheses. 

\subsection{User engagement and spaced repetition effectiveness report}
The outcome from the analysis of data will be the foundations to draw conclusions about the effects of gamifying a spaced repetition software. The report will be aimed to interpret the results from the analysis data and identify possible causes for such results. Moreover, information about the limitations of the project will be provided as well. Either the hypotheses have been confirmed or denied, the report will provide the guidelines for further work in the same field or related ones.

\section{Risk Management}
Throughout every stage of the process, there might be a series of potential risks that can delay or compromise the flow of the project. To diminish the impact of such potential risks it is necessary to identify and categorize them. Moreover, an strategy to cope with them is required. The information in Table \ref{tab:risks} describes the potential risks in every stage and how to manage them.
